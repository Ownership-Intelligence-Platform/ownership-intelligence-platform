Here's a refined and more actionable version of your prompt, with clearer context and guidance for better results:

"Hi, I have a code file that's growing complex and hard to maintain. Could you help refactor it to improve clarity and readability?

Specifically, please:

- Split large methods/functions into smaller, single-responsibility ones
- Organize related code into separate files (e.g., utility functions, core logic, helpers)
- Create a folder structure if needed (e.g., `utils/`, `components/`, `services/`) to group related files
- Maintain functionality while making the code flow easier to follow
- Add brief comments where helpful to explain key sections or file purposes

I'll share the code shortly—let me know if you need any additional context about its purpose or existing structure!"

This version is more explicit about your goals, outlines specific refactoring actions, and sets expectations for the output, which will help the person assisting you deliver more targeted results.
